# liri-node-app
Liri Bot App was coded using Node.js. 
Liri is a Language  interpretation and recognition interface and a command line Node App that takes in parameters and gives you back data by sending request using the Axious package to Bands in town, Spotify, and oMDB APIâ€™s. 
The Java Script File (liri.js) has four functions that the user will pass in parameters from the Terminal then Liri will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for Concerts, and Open Movie Data Base for movies.
